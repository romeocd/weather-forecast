# weather-forecast

## Description

The weather forecast dashboard was created as a simple weather forecast application that allows a user to view the weather outlook for multiple cities. The dashboard features dynamically updated HTML and CSS while using the 
OpenWeather API. 

## Usage

When the weather dashboard is opened, there is a search bar for a city.
Upon searching a city, the current and future conditions for that city is presented and added to the search history.
Viewing the current weather conditions of the city will present the city name, the date, icon representing the 
weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and the wind speed.
Viewing the future weather conditions for that city will present a 5-day forecast that displays the date,
icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
Clicking the city in the search history will again present the current and future conditions for that city.
